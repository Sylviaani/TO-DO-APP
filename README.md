My name is Sylvia Ani and I am the owner and publisher of the Calendar TO-DO App, which is my portfolio project in alx.

Here is a link to my deployed site; https://sylviaani.github.io/TO-DO-APP/. You can also reach me on LinkedIn with this link; https://www.linkedin.com/in/sylvia-ani-595b0324b/, where I will be writing a blog article about my project.

This is a web app, so there won't be any issue of installation. All you have to do is go to the project's site and start to-doing.
Once you get to the page, You simply click on the date you want to schedule for, a form will immediately pop up that will allow you input the details of the tasks you want to schedule for. Once you are done, you simply click on 'Add Task'.

This was a solo project, so all research, findings, coding and deployment was done by me. I hereby claim all rights and licensing to this project.
Also, if there will be related apps, I will let you know. Stay tuned I guess üòè

PS. Here is a snippet of the project;

This is my first time creating something like this, so of course there were a lot of technical issues encountered and resolved.

I had a hard time initializing my FullCalendar; to get it to show on my website, to get it to accept click functions was even more harder. But, after series of debugging and researching, it finally worked!. I think I nearly cried when it did üò¢. This particular issue really took a toll on me, because what's a Calendar TO-DO App without a calendar?. Other challenges came up along the way but nothing compared to this.

I'm truly excited for this project to be the next big thing!. üòÉ
